## 1. Build vs. Buy Analysis
Before committing to custom development, evaluate existing solutions.

### 1.1 Market Analysis
- Are there SaaS products that meet 80%+ of the requirements?
- What are the customization limits of off-the-shelf solutions?
- Cost analysis: Licensing (Buy) vs. Engineering hours + Maintenance (Build)

### 1.2 Strategic Value
- Is this capability a core differentiator for the business? (If yes, lean towards Build)
- Does owning the IP provide a competitive advantage?

## 2. Technology Stack Selection
Select the core technologies based on team expertise, ecosystem, and requirements.

### 2.1 Backend & Languages
- Primary language(s) (e.g., Go, Node.js, Python, Java): [Prompt]
- Frameworks: [Prompt]

### 2.2 Frontend
- Web frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular): [Prompt]
- Mobile strategy (Native, Flutter, React Native): [Prompt]

### 2.3 Vendor Evaluation (RFPs)
- List critical 3rd party vendors to evaluate (e.g., Auth0, Stripe, CMS):
    - [ ] Vendor A
    - [ ] Vendor B

## 3. Proof of Concept (PoC) / Vertical Slice
Validate risky assumptions with code before full architecture.

### 3.1 Key Risks to Validate
- [ ] Performance throughput of specific components
- [ ] Integration feasibility with legacy systems
- [ ] Learning curve of new technology

### 3.2 Vertical Slice Scope
Define the minimum scope to prove viability:
- [Prompt: Describe the minimal feature set to build]
