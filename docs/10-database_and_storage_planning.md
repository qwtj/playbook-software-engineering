## 1. Storage and Database

### 1.1 Data Characteristics
- What types of data will be stored? (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
- What is the expected initial dataset size?
- What is the projected data growth rate?
- What is the expected read/write frequency?
- Will the system need to handle high concurrency?

### 1.2 Relational vs. NoSQL
- Is a relational database required? (RDS, Azure SQL, Cloud SQL)
- Would a NoSQL solution be more appropriate? (DynamoDB, Cosmos DB, Firestore)
- What kind of queries will be run? (e.g. joins, aggregations, key-value lookups)
- Is ACID compliance necessary?
- Do we need strong or eventual consistency?
- Are there existing tools or platforms already in use?
- What is the team’s expertise with relational vs. NoSQL databases?

### 1.3 File/Object Storage
- What types of files or objects will be stored?
- What is the expected file size range?
- How frequently will files be accessed or updated?
- Which cloud provider is preferred? (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
- Are there specific performance, access control, or encryption requirements?

### 1.4 Backup and Retention
- What is the desired Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?
- What is the desired Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?
- How long should data be retained?
- Are there regulatory or compliance requirements for data retention?
- What type of backup strategy is needed? (full, incremental, snapshots)
- Is cross-region or off-site replication required?

## 2. Data Modeling
