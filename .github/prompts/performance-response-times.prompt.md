Let's focus on **5.1 Response Times and Throughput** from the performance and monitoring playbook.

Ask me:
- What are the expected response times or throughput targets?
- Are there SLA targets (e.g., p95, p99 latency)?
- What are peak load expectations?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
