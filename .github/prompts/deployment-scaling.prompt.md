Let's focus on **2.2 Infrastructure and Scaling** from the deployment strategy playbook.

Ask me:
- How should the application scale under increased load?
- Are there specific hosting requirements or limitations?
- How many environments are needed (dev, test, staging, production)?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 2

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
