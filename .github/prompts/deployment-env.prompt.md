Let's focus on **2.1 Environment Approach** from the deployment strategy playbook.

Ask me:
- Should the deployment be container-based or VM-based?
- Which environment constraints (regulatory, organizational) influence this decision?
- Is a hybrid approach feasible?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
