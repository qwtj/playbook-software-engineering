Let's focus on **5.3 Real-time Monitoring and Alerting** from the performance and monitoring playbook.

Ask me:
- How will real-time monitoring and alerting be implemented?
- Who receives alerts and through which channels?
- Are escalation policies needed?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
