Let's focus on **1.2 User Flows** from the requirements playbook.

Ask me:
- Who are the different types of end users?
- How does each user type interact with the system?
- What actions should be streamlined or automated?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md)

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
