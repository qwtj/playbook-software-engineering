Let's focus on **4.1 Authentication and Authorization** from the security and compliance playbook.

Ask me:
- Are there specific authentication and authorization mechanisms needed?
- Which identity provider (SSO, IAM, Entra ID, etc.) will be used?
- Is MFA required? What about RBAC or ABAC?
- Are short-lived tokens or OAuth2/SAML needed?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
