Please provide a **consolidated summary** of the security and compliance requirements we've gathered.

Organize the output under:
- **4.1 Authentication and Authorization** - identity provider, MFA, RBAC/ABAC, token protocols
- **4.2 Regulatory and Compliance** - standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI), audit logging, retention
- **4.3 Data Encryption** - at rest and in transit, standards, key management

Use markdown tables for compliance standards, encryption requirements, and auth mechanisms. Include any diagrams we've created. Format it so I can copy it into my requirements document.
