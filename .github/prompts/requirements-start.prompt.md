Start an interactive requirements gathering session for the application we're building.

Follow the structure in [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 1.

Introduce yourself briefly, then ask the first questions from **1.1 Core Features**:
- What are the primary functions or tasks the application must perform?
- Which features are critical for the first release versus future enhancements?

Remember: Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always ask for confirmation. The user may have their own materials.
