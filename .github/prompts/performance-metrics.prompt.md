Let's focus on **5.2 Metrics and Logs** from the performance and monitoring playbook.

Ask me:
- Which metrics or logs are essential to capture?
- What retention and compliance requirements apply to logs?
- Which KPIs should be tracked?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 5

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
