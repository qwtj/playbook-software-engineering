Please provide a **consolidated summary** of the performance and monitoring requirements we've gathered.

Organize the output under:
- **5.1 Response Times and Throughput** - targets, SLA (p95/p99), peak load
- **5.2 Metrics and Logs** - essential metrics/logs, retention, compliance, KPIs
- **5.3 Real-time Monitoring and Alerting** - implementation, alert channels, escalation policies

Use markdown tables for SLA targets, metrics/KPIs, and alert channels. Include any diagrams we've created. Format it so I can copy it into my requirements document.
