Let's focus on **4.3 Data Encryption** from the security and compliance playbook.

Ask me:
- How will data be encrypted at rest and in transit?
- What encryption standards are required (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2+)?
- How will keys be managed (KMS, Key Vault, rotation)?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
