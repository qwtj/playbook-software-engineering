Let's focus on **4.2 Regulatory and Compliance** from the security and compliance playbook.

Ask me:
- Are there regulatory or compliance standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI) to consider?
- What audit logging and retention requirements apply?
- Who will have access to audit logs?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 4

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
