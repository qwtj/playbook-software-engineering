Let's focus on **1.1 Core Features** from the requirements playbook.

Ask me:
- What are the primary functions or tasks the application must perform?
- Which features are critical for the first release versus future enhancements?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md)

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
