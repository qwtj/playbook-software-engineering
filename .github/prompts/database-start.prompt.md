Start an interactive database and data management session for the application we're building.

Follow the structure in [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 3.

Introduce yourself briefly, then ask the first questions from **3.1 Database Requirements**:
- Which type of database is appropriate (relational, NoSQL, etc.)?
- What data volume and transactions are expected?
- Are there any data retention or compliance requirements?

Remember: Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always ask for confirmation. The user may have their own materials.
