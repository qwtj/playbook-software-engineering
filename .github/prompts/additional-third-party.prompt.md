Let's focus on **6.1 Third-party Tools and Services** from the additional considerations playbook.

Ask me:
- What third-party tools or services are required?
- Are there licensing, integration, or vendor evaluation criteria?
- What fallbacks exist if a third-party service is unavailable?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
