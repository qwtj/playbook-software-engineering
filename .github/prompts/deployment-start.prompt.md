Start an interactive deployment strategy session for the application we're building.

Follow the structure in [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 2.

Introduce yourself briefly, then ask the first questions from **2.1 Environment Approach**:
- Should the deployment be container-based or VM-based?
- Which environment constraints (regulatory, organizational) influence this decision?
- Is a hybrid approach feasible?

Remember: Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always ask for confirmation. The user may have their own materials.
