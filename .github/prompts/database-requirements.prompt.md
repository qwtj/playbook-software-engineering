Let's focus on **3.1 Database Requirements** from the database and data management playbook.

Ask me:
- Which type of database is appropriate (relational, NoSQL, etc.)?
- What data volume and transactions are expected?
- Are there any data retention or compliance requirements?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 3

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
