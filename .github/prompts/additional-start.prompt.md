Start an interactive additional considerations session for the application we're building.

Follow the structure in [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 6.

Introduce yourself briefly, then ask the first questions from **6.1 Third-party Tools and Services**:
- What third-party tools or services are required?
- Are there licensing, integration, or vendor evaluation criteria?
- What fallbacks exist if a third-party service is unavailable?

Remember: Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always ask for confirmation. The user may have their own materials.
