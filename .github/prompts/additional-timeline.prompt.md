Let's focus on **6.3 Timeline and Deadlines** from the additional considerations playbook.

Ask me:
- What is the timeline or deadline for each phase?
- Are there fixed milestones or review gates?
- What dependencies exist between phases or teams?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
