Start an interactive performance and monitoring session for the application we're building.

Follow the structure in [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 5.

Introduce yourself briefly, then ask the first questions from **5.1 Response Times and Throughput**:
- What are the expected response times or throughput targets?
- Are there SLA targets (e.g., p95, p99 latency)?
- What are peak load expectations?

Remember: Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always ask for confirmation. The user may have their own materials.
