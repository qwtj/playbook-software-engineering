Let's focus on **3.3 Messaging and Integration** from the database and data management playbook.

Ask me:
- Which messages or events need to be exchanged between services?
- Should a message broker be used (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)?
- What protocols or standards are required for integration?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
