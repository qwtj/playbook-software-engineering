Please provide a **consolidated summary** of the application functionality and UX requirements we've gathered.

Organize the output under:
- **1.1 Core Features** - primary functions, critical vs. future prioritization
- **1.2 User Flows** - user types, interactions, automation candidates
- **1.3 UX/UI Considerations** - design tools, systems, guidelines, accessibility, localization, devices

Use markdown tables for feature prioritization. Include any diagrams we've created. Format it so I can copy it into my requirements document.
