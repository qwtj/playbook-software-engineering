Please provide a **consolidated summary** of the database and data management requirements we've gathered.

Organize the output under:
- **3.1 Database Requirements** - database type, volume, transactions, retention, compliance
- **3.2 Caching** - data to cache, invalidation/consistency, dedicated caching service
- **3.3 Messaging and Integration** - messages/events, message broker, protocols and standards

Use markdown tables for database type comparison, caching strategy, and integration options. Include any diagrams we've created. Format it so I can copy it into my requirements document.
