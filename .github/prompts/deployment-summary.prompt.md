Please provide a **consolidated summary** of the deployment strategy we've gathered.

Organize the output under:
- **2.1 Environment Approach** - container vs VM, constraints, hybrid feasibility
- **2.2 Infrastructure and Scaling** - scaling strategy, hosting requirements, environments count

Use markdown tables for environment count and scaling strategy. Include any diagrams we've created. Format it so I can copy it into my requirements document.
