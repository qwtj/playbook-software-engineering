Please provide a **consolidated summary** of the additional considerations we've gathered.

Organize the output under:
- **6.1 Third-party Tools and Services** - required tools/services, licensing, fallbacks
- **6.2 Risks and Dependencies** - risks, dependencies, tracking and escalation
- **6.3 Timeline and Deadlines** - phases, milestones, review gates, phase dependencies

Use markdown tables for third-party tools, risk matrix, and phase timeline. Include any diagrams we've created. Format it so I can copy it into my requirements document.
