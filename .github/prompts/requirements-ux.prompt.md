Let's focus on **1.3 UX/UI Considerations** from the requirements playbook.

Ask me:
- What design software should be used?
- What design system should be used?
- What design guidelines or branding requirements must be followed?
- Are there accessibility or localization needs?
- Which devices or screen sizes must be supported?

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
