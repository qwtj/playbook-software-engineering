Let's focus on **3.2 Caching** from the database and data management playbook.

Ask me:
- What types of data benefit from caching?
- How critical is cache invalidation and consistency?
- Should a dedicated caching service be used?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 3

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
