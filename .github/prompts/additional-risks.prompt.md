Let's focus on **6.2 Risks and Dependencies** from the additional considerations playbook.

Ask me:
- What potential risks or dependencies need mitigation?
- Are there technical, organizational, or vendor dependencies?
- How will risks be tracked and escalated?

Reference: [docs/01-requirements_gathering.md](../../docs/01-requirements_gathering.md) Section 6

Before fetching documentation or creating diagrams, always confirm first. I may have my own.
