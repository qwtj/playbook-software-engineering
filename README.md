# Software Engineering Playbook

This repository is a curated collection of documents, processes, and workflows designed to guide software engineering practices and support the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as a centralized reference for teams to understand requirements gathering, architecture planning, infrastructure, security, observability, and more.

## Documentation Structure

The `docs/` folder contains 22 comprehensive guides covering the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), organized by phase:
